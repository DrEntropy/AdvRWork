## 13.2.1 

```{r}
library(sloop)
```


1. `t.test` is a generic, which does the student t.test  on objects based on what class they are. `methods` suggests that there is only the default and `formula`. 

`t.data.frame` is a method (for class data.frame, method t = transpose)

5. 
```{r}
x <- ecdf(rpois(100, 10))
class(x)
```

looks like it must be based on a function. Which makes sense

```{r}
typeof(unclass(x))
```

Interesting. I think this is because there is no other way to make a callable object.  Not sure though.

```{r}
attributes(x)
```

6. 

```{r}
x <- table(rpois(100,5))
class(x)
```

```{r}
typeof(unclass(x))
```

Underlying type is an integer array


```{r}
attributes(x)
```

## 13.3.4

*skipping*, but I did look at the solution to #1. 

They did not approach it the way i would have! I would have used ... to allow construction in the same way that lists are constructed.
